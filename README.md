# Data Analysis Boot Camp Project/Hackathon


## Project Overview


In this final project for Digitaley Drive Boot Camp Project, I leveraged Power BI and Excel to analyze various datasets, uncovering key insights and trends. By utilizing advanced data visualization techniques and analytical tools, I aim to present a comprehensive understanding of the data, facilitating informed decision-making. This project highlights the importance of data analysis in identifying patterns, optimizing processes, and driving strategic initiatives across different sectors.


### Data Sources

#### First Data Source


Global Stores Sales Data: The data set used in this analysis is the "Global Store Cleaned Data.xlsx", contaning detailed information of all sales made by the store to various parts of the world.

- Excel - Data Cleaning, Data Analysis, Creating Report and Visualization


#### Data Cleaning Process


In this phase, the following tasks were performed;
1. Data loading and Inspection.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Data cleaning and Formatting.

#### Exploratory Data Analysis


EDA is exploring the Sales data to answer key questions, such as;


- Question 1.
a) What are the three countries that generated the highest total profit for Global Superstore in 2014?

Note: For this question, assume that Southeast Asia comprises Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar
(Burma), the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam.

#### Data Analysis 

Include some interesting code/features worked with.
``` excel
Total Ratings = Overall Ratings + Service Ratings + Food Ratings

```

#### Results/Findings


 1) Total number of restaurants under re-view is 127, which vary from North America, Asia, Europe to South American Cuisine.
a) The first graph shows what top 10 restaurants have the highest ranking based on the different types of cuisine. it is quite evident to see that the type of cuisine plays a very important role in the restaurant picked and customers that choose to visit them, Mexican cuisine from the restaurant called Gorditas Doa Gloria, while the least rated is Mexican and American from the restaurant called Vips.
b) Customer preference plays a huge role on the type of cuisine that is ordered or even what restaurant to go to or order from.

 2) The main consumer demographics in this data include; Age, Marital status, habits, Family size(Children), Occupation, Budget, City, State, Transportation.
a) The analysis above shows that there is no bias in the data sampled as varying ranges of the consumer demographics was used in this data sample.

 3) From the above analysis, there is still a niche that has not been tapped into and this is the Vegan or vegetarians, have a restaurant with very good vegan options this is a potion of the market that can be exploited.


#### Recommendations

#### Data Cleaning Process

#### Data Analysis 

Include some interesting code/features worked with however none was used here.

#### Results/Findings
1) The top 3 countries with the highest sales for the year 2014, with first place going to the United States, 2nd place is Australia and the 3rd is France.
